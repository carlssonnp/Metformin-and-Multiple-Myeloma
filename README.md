This study examined the association between the diabetes drug Metformin and the progression of Monoclonal Gammapothy of Undetermined 
Significance (MGUS) to Multiple Myeloma (MM). My roles included creation of the algorithm that classified patients as frequent metformin users versus non-metformin users, as inconsistent usage of the drug could confound the analysis. I also participated in manuscript revision. Please see below for a link to the full text of the article.
