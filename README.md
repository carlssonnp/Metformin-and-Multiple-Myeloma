This study examined the association between the diabetes drug metformin and the progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined 
significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM), finding a protective association. My primary responsibility was creation of the algorithm that classified patients as metformin users, as inconsistent usage patterns were prevalent in the cohort. My algorithm, written in SAS, was designed to identify consistent users, so that the biological effect of metformin would be accurately represented in our statistical analyses.
